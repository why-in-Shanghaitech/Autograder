      We noticed that your project threw an IndexError on q1.
      While many things may cause this, it may have been from
      assuming a certain number of successors from a state space
      or assuming a certain number of actions available from a given
      state. Try making your code more general (no hardcoded indices)
      and submit again!

        We noticed that your project threw an ValueError on q3.
        While many things may cause this, it may have been from assuming
        a certain size or structure to the state space. For example, if you have
        a line of code assuming that the state is (x, y) and we run your code
        on a state space with (x, y, z), this error could be thrown. Try
        making your code more general and submit again!
