# Autograder

This is an example autograder adapted from the pacman project, CS188 in Berkeley.

## Get started

If you're familiar with the pacman project, you may skip this session since the usage is almost the same. If you've never tried the pacman project, here are some commands that might be helpful:

If you want to get help, run
```sh
    python autograder.py -h
```

If you want to test your code, run
```sh
    python autograder.py
```

If you want to test your code for a specified question, for example, question 1, run
```sh
    python autograder.py -q q1
```

If you want to mute outputs, run
```sh
    python autograder.py -m
```

If you want to test your code for a specified testcase, for example, q1/test_1.test, run
```sh
    python autograder.py -t test_cases/q1/test_1
```

If you want to show the input parameter of your failed cases in question 1, run
```sh
    python autograder.py -q q1 -p
```
