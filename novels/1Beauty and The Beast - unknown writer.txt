    BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.

    Once upon a time, in a very far-off country, there lived a mer-chant who had been so fortunate in all his undertakings that hewas  enormously  rich.       As  he  had,  however,  six  sons  and  sixdaughters, he found that his money was not too much to let themall have everything they fancied, as they were accustomed to do.

    But one day a most unexpected misfortune befell them. Theirhouse  caught  fire  and  was  speedily  burnt  to  the  ground,  withall the splendid furniture, the books, pictures, gold, silver, andprecious goods it contained; and this was only the beginning oftheir troubles. Their father, who had until this moment prosperedin all ways, suddenly lost every ship he had upon the sea, eitherby  dint  of  pirates,  shipwreck,  or  fire.    Then  he  heard  that  hisclerks in distant countries, whom he trusted entirely, had provedunfaithful;  and at last from great wealth he fell into the direstpoverty.
